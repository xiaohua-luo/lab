## 1. Virus-driven immune remodeling in transplantation and cellular therapies

We study how CMV, EBV, and other viral exposures reshape immune reconstitution after HSCT, CAR-T therapy, and NK-cell–based treatments. Using longitudinal CyTOF and single-cell sequencing, we map immune trajectories and identify signatures linked to toxicity, relapse, and infection. Computational models integrate viral kinetics with immune dynamics to guide precision monitoring and therapeutic decision-making.

## 2. Precision immunology and immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia

AML serves as a key disease model to understand therapy-induced immune remodeling. We investigate how induction regimens such as HAV, antigen drift, and immune microenvironment differences between pediatric and adult AML shape treatment outcomes. We also develop and evaluate AML-directed immunotherapies—including MSLN CAR-T cells, CMV-based vaccines, and viral-antigen–driven immunogenic strategies—to improve antileukemic immunity and long-term survival.
