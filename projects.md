## 1. Virus-driven immune remodeling in transplantation and cellular therapies

We study how CMV, EBV, and other viral exposures reshape immune reconstitution after HSCT, CAR-T therapy, and other advanced cellular treatments. Using longitudinal CyTOF and single-cell sequencing, we map immune trajectories and identify signatures linked to toxicity, relapse, and infection. Computational models integrate viral kinetics with immune dynamics to guide precision monitoring and therapeutic decision-making.

## 2. Precision immunology and immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia

AML serves as a key disease model to understand therapy-induced immune remodeling. We investigate how induction regimens such as HAV, antigen drift, and immune microenvironment in AML patients shape treatment outcomes. We also develop and evaluate AML-directed immunotherapies—including CAR-T cells, vaccines, and viral-antigen–driven immunogenic strategies—to improve antileukemic immunity and long-term survival.
